    "Are some technical objects just in the background, while the closer one gets to an epistemic situation, the more attention needs to be paid to the technical objects that are implied",
    "Machinic creativity not as the attribute of a technical individual, but as an operation of regulation of the technical assemblage",
    "Thinking the living being in the Technical Milieu and as a medium",
    "What are the particular spatial conditions that allow for epistemic phenomena to occur? Would a word such as “density” or “saturation” be appropriate to convey how those minute moments and events seem to pull the experiment together?",
    "The aspiration to follow technical objects in their evolution is driven by an anthropological and ethical interest. Techniques have meaning and express life",
    "To understand techniques as an expression of life should not be mistaken as an esoteric claim: Technical objects are the result of 'social' actions, since they are actions of human beings. Within the realm of the social, technical objects transform and structural human practices",
    "Binarisms that, mistaken for veritable states in and of themselves, can mislead our self-conceptions and lead us to believe that we are not metastable, but moving inexorably towards an a priori set point",
    "Far from conquering nature or reshaping his environment, primitive man’s first concern was to utilize his overdeveloped, intensely active nervous system, and to give form to a human self, set apart from his original animal self by the fabrication of symbols",
    "We and our tools have become “hybrids”—“cyborgs”",
    "Technology is not anthropologically universal, being enabled and constrained by particular cosmologies, which go beyond functionalities and utilities",
    "This transfer from intuition to calculation and construction can be interpreted as ”an emancipation of human beings from their conditions earthly animals” “transcendentally”, on the other hand, such a crisis “remains to be thought through”",
    "Whenever we construct knowledge around an unfamiliar Other, we make what is local and familiar to them familiar to us through a process of reduction by passing what is observed through our own concepts of the world, in what amounts to a “globalization” of knowledge",
    "We should be aware that the concepts we hold to be very familiar and “natural” can themselves be subject to other interpretations and consequently, reductions, when viewed from the perspective of a cosmological or cultural Other",
    "Under the impression of a penetration of technical phenomena into the deeper layers of human relations of being, as cybernetic machines have made obvious, one is forced to see technology as a possible solution to that anthropologically determinable disproportion [between man and nature]. Through technology, man creates for himself an environment appropriate to his dual role as a natural and spiritual being",
    "The cybernetic extension of modern technology means its extension under the skin of the world; Technology can no longer be considered in any way isolated (objectified) from the world process and its sociological, ideological, and vital phases. It involves everything, it has been taken on an intensified consuming character. Literature, art, music take on its features",
    "These socio-technological systems are less a fact, however, than an invention through which digital cultures, deeply rooted in technological forms of cooperation, can come into existence",
    "Not that comparisons between the animal and human worlds are anything particularly novel; what is new is the fact that today they are meant seriously, that the anthropological supremacy of the human is no longer capable of upholding itself in the current technical-organic overall structure.",
    "Such a rewriting of art history and sound art practices will have to be acutely aware of issues of globalization, postcolonialism, and decolonization; it will need to integrate representations on the Internet with those of live concerts, installations, and interviews; it must reach out toward anthropological methods; and it should make aesthetic considerations central to its analysis",
    "Where there is presence and affect, there remains abundance, excess and the possibility of recording",
    "The “technique” of an action refers to the means employed as opposed to the meaning or end to which the action is, in the last analysis, oriented",
    "“Rational” technique is a choice of means which is consciously and systematically oriented to the experience and reflection of the actor, which consists, at the highest level of rationality, in scientific knowledge",
    "In such a negative anthropological situation, belief means the ability to project possibilities for bifurcation, in a system that is on the way to becoming closed and requires a change that by itself the system cannot calculate. Such possibilities are those prescribed and certified by work-knowledge, life-knowledge, and conceptual knowledge, that is, by knowledge of how to live, do, and think",
    "Some anthropological data suggest that the concept of 'person' is not limited to the human class, but that animals or objects may possess 'person qualities' in that they are perceived as origins and causes of changes in the field, as endowed with a power of their own",
    "Relation must be understood as something that precedes the formation of the terms of the relation (subject, object, individual, groups, indeed all forms of collective human and nonhuman agents): predominantly, it must traverse all modes and levels of Being, from the micro to the macro, meaning that it is a “modality of being",
    "Enaction as the dynamic relationship whereby living organisms and their environment co-emerge, a process in which techniques is revealed as ‘anthropologically constitutive’",
    "Is it possible to take this historical moment to rethink digital technology, not only to understand its transformative power in new social phenomena but also to open up the question of technology and technodiversity? Is it possible to nourish digital technologies with new epistemologies and epistemes in light of the concept of cosmotechnics?",
    "We have also challenged the universalist concept of technology and proposed that in order to break from such technological determinism, it is necessary to reopen the question of technodiversity, which is also the condition of noodiversity. Therefore, we must be critical with notions of the future of humanity presented as the realization of homo deus or the progress of modernity",
    "Technical externalization leads to a new type of evolution and diversity: beyond vital evolution and biodiversity through the emergence of biological organs and organisms, there is also technical and social evolution, technodiversity and sociodiversity through the production of new technical organs, new ways of life, new social organizations",
    "Technics are anthropologically universal in the process of hominization—the understanding of the human as a species because it is the exteriorization of memory and the liberation of human organs",
    "The multiplicity of cosmotechnics implies multiple epistemologies and epistemes which can contribute to reflection on the development of technologies, opening up a discourse on technodiversity for overcoming the current homogenization and planetarization of enframing actualized in the Anthropocene",
    "A planetary thinking is not about mere acceleration, but rather diversification. It is called forth by planetarization, and simultaneously summons all efforts to go beyond it and transform it. The three notions of diversity that constitute what we call planetary thinking are biodiversity, noodiversity, and technodiversity",
    "Biodiversity is the correlate of technodiversity, since without technodiversity, we will only witness the disappearing of species by a homogenous rationality",
    "Technology must be analysed according to different orders of magnitude, or in more technical terms, different levels of abstraction. Each order possesses certain degrees of autonomy. In the same way, technodiversity is also made possible by noodiversity. By noodiversity, we mean the diversity of thinking and creativity",
    "Despite the common role played by technology in the process of hominisation, namely the becoming of human beings, shouldn’t we also reassert the existence of a technological diversity within this process, and render it visible for re-examination? How, then, can we articulate multiple cosmotechnics and to what extent is this articulation useful to imagining a technodiversity in the Anthropocene?",
    "If we want to go beyond modernity, and if the non-modern is to mean something beyond the modern’s mere reverse, or that which negatively adheres to the modern, then the persistence of the non-modern has to be understood as a transformative power, which allows, or at least serves a starting point, for the reopening of a technodiversity",
    "We need to “challenge the noosphere for the sake of a noodiversity as an overcoming of the system” and to recognise that “noodiversity also demands technodiversity as its material support”",
    "Our inquiry cannot stop here; there are still many unresolved questions: how to raise the question of technodiversity when intellectuals are craving for an artificial general intelligence (AGI)? We must return to history in order to orient where we are standing but also with a sense of distance. Will it be possible to find strategies to liberate us from this apocalyptic end of technological singularity and reopen the question of the future?",
    "It is necessary to rediscover and develop epistemologies and epistemes alternative to dominant ones, as the new practice of diplomacy, for example, through the comparison between epistemologies of African medicine and Western medicine. From the perspective of art, it is also possible to do so with “becoming art.” Becoming art here means an aesthetic and epistemic revolution. It doesn’t mean making things more beautiful in the way of cosmetic surgery or decoration, but rather an education of sensibility",
    "The affirmation of different natures is an affirmation of locality, and such a question of locality cannot be fully posed as a return to indigenous knowledge or a Romantic concept of nature, but rather as a reopening of the question of technodiversity and the strategies needed to maintain and continue the ramification of these diversities",
    "Evolution is possible only when there is diversity, since biology has already taught us that evolution should be understood as coevolution. The artificial selection applied in the population (instead of Darwinian natural selection) will finally lead to the reduction and even elimination of technodiversity and therefore noodiversity. The question thus raised is, will the recursive thinking in cybernetics allow us to relaunch the question of organicism and technodiversity, or will it, being driven by efficiency for the final cause imposed by capital, finally only realize a purely deterministic complex system that is moving toward its own destruction",
    "The fundamental question is the regrounding of technology. We have to emphasize that this is not to add an ethics to AI or robotics, since we won't be able to change the technological tendency by just adding more values. Instead we have to provide new frameworks for future technological developments so that a new geopolitics can emerge that is not based on an apocalyptic singularity but technodiversity; this is also the reason cosmotechnics is a political concept",
    "The unity of the technical object, its individuality, its specific nature, are the characteristics of consistency and convergence of its genesis",
    "The techniques, after having mobilized and separated from the actual world the schematic figures of a magical world, return toward the actual world to unite with it through the coincidence of cement and rock, of the cable and the valley, of the pole and the hill; a new reticulation is brought into being, which privileges certain places of the world in a synergical alliance of technical schemes and natural powers",
    "Matter is matter because it receives a positive property which enables it to be modeled. To be modeled does not mean to undergo arbitrary displacements, but to order its plasticity according to definite forces that stabilize the deformation. The technical operation is the mediation between an inter-elementary unit and an infra-elementary unit. The pure form already contains gestures, and the primary matter has the capacity to become; the gestures contained in the form meet the becoming of the matter and modulate it",
    "Today, nature can be separated from culture less than ever, and we must learn to think “transversally” about the interactions between ecosystems, the mechanosphere and the universe of social and individual references",
    "An art of eco (oikos-house) ... ways of domesticating existential territories, whether they concern intimate ways of being, the body, the environment or large contextual sets relating to ethnicity, nation or even the general rights of humanity... An ecology of ideas (of minds) that is not separated from practices…",
    "The technique of the image always refers to a metaphysics of the imagination…",
    "The specific technicity of the mirror is inscribed in the flesh as much as it «draws my flesh outside», so that even the human body–the body of the other–can itself become a mirror",
    "The technical object is not beautiful in just any circumstances; it is beautiful when it encounters a singular and notable place of the world. The high-tension lines when they are crossing valleys, the car when it is steering, the train when it leaves or comes out of the tunnel [...]. The technical object is beautiful when it encounters a ground that agrees with it, of which it can be the proper figure, that is, when it completes and expresses the world",
    "What is «original» is not human enhancement by technology or the act of delegating functions to technical objects or machines, but rather the ontological gap and internal alteration inscribed within human sensibility or flesh, with regard to which technique is but an amplification, a further articulation, both natural and cultural. In other words, what is «original» is the power of the body to project itself in the world, to exceed itself as symbolic expression – not despite but through the thickness of sensibility"
